Task 1: Titanic survival prediction ðŸ›³ ðŸ›³ 

Use the Titanic dataset to build a model that predicts whether a

passenger on the Titanic survived or not.

In this I have made use of juypter lab to create a model to predict a whether a person survived or not.

First we import the libraries and then read the file the display the head values after we perform some operations like removing the outlier to make the data more efficient. From this we can check whether a person survived or not by using the regression model.

I also made use of various parameter where we transformed the sex of people from male or female as 0 or 1.

Then we train the model to make predictions for the survival and my model was found to have 79 % accuracy. âœ” âœ”
